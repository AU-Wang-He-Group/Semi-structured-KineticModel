# Semi-structured-KineticModel
*This Kinetic model consist of 4 main Models to run, including the experimental data:

1-Coculture vs single culture 2-Gas composition 3-Light intensity 4-Inoculum ratio

-which all the models use the same function named "functionV7".

*There is an addtional model to test the coculture growth without havind the self shading effect:

Withoutselfshed -which uses "functionWO" to operate.
